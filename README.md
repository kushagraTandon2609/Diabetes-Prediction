🩺 Diabetes Prediction Web App

A Machine Learning-based Diabetes Prediction Model that uses patient data (age, glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc.) to predict the risk of diabetes.
The app provides early detection insights to assist healthcare professionals with data-driven diagnosis.

✨ Features

🔹 Interactive Web App built with Streamlit
🔹 Supports multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
🔹 Input fields for patient health parameters
🔹 Accuracy & Confusion Matrix visualization
🔹 User-friendly interface for predictions

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend / Web App: Streamlit
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
